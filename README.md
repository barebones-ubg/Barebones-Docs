# Barebones UBG Documentation
Welcome to Barebones UBG!

## What is Barebones-UBG?
It is a project that aims to help beginners start making their own UBG sites easily!
The end goal here is to leave the reader with enough knowledge to create their own UBG sites!

## Disclaimer
I am well aware that the vast amount of people using this will mainly be children, so this next bit is for them.

- By building a site using Barebones, you are required to give credit to Barebones somewhere easily visible. We can't really do anything if you don't other than demand you to do so in an issue.
- I (DotLYHiyou), Am not found liable for any time taken away from class or any other school environments if someone is caught using a site built with Barebone's tools.

## Links
This only exists so that I can remember to update them. These are the ONLY official docs links.
