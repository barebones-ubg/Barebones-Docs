## Disclaimer if you use this. 
By building a site using Barebones, you are required to give credit to Barebones somewhere easily visible. We can't really do anything if you don't other than demand you to do so in an issue.
## About the project
I, (DotLYHiyou) wanted to build something to help people build UBG sites, since they were hard to find, scarce, and would easily get blocked. I would also get people telling me they wanted to create sites like me, but didn't know how.
(I also wanted to work on something new other than my own UBG site for once.) That's basically the whole initiative of this site.
## Future Notes
I may or may not completely rework this project into a plug and play framework-ish thing under a new name once I learn enough.
