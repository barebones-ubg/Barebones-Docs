To be able to start working, you need to start with one of the templates. Then you will be able to make your site from the ground up. I will also show you how to add games in the next guide, but this guide only has 1 game just to show how things work.

## Getting the example.

1. Create a Github Account if you haven't already.
2. Go to [this github repo](https://github.com/barebones-ubg/HTML-Plain) and fork it onto your account. Make sure you don't change anything about the fork.
3. Go to [the codespaces page](https://github.com/codespaces) and press "New codespace".
4. In the little menu, go to select a repo > The repo you just forked. Then click Create.
5. Wait for the thing to load. 
6. Once in the editor, go to the terminal and type ```npm install ``` to install the dependencies needed for it to work.
7. Go ahead and after it is done, type ``` npx servor ```.
8. You will see something pop up, now click "Open in browser".

Doing this correctly will look something like this:

I know, it looks so trash, compared to other sites, but this is because it has zero styling. In another basic guide, we will learn how to style, but for now? You have this.
